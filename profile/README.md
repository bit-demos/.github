# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Bit Demos

Here you will find various [demo projects](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/~scopes) to help you learn more about Bit. 

Bit is an extensible, **open-source** toolchain for building independent components, and composing them into high-performance and consistent modular and component-driven apps at speed.

It makes it easy to develop modular software projects from independently versioned components, connected through a dependency graph and which can be owned by numerous autonomous teams, collaborating together to deliver modern apps at speed, consistency and scale. It is a simple, modular and efficient way to build a single web application, while allowing to scale to any amount of teams collaborating together.

In the demos you will notice we have separate repos yet the stores are using the components from the base-ui and ecommerce repo. Bit allows us to easily share compoents across different repos and teams.
